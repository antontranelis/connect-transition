# Connect Transition
*is a plattform which helps to create a decentralized network of selfsuistainable projects.*

We build a content platform, which offers all the informations and interactions, which are needed to  form the network, sharing resources, spreading informations and motivating people.

The **Project List** aims to list all existing projects involved in transition, with all the informations those projects want to share. In there Blogs all the Projects are able to share Updates, if they wish. Users will be able to find projects in the near of there location.

In the **Event Calender** all relevant events will be listed.
We want to offer all the projects the ability to start and list their Crowdfundings.

The **Knowledge Database** will be a place to share knowledge, How-Toâ€™s, stories, learnings and documentations.
